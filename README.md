# Guess-the-number
This Java program lets users guess a randomly generated number and provides hints. It also calculates and displays the number of attempts and a corresponding IQ grade.
This Java program is a simple number guessing game where the user is prompted to guess a random number between 0 and 99. The program provides hints to the user to help them guess the number correctly. It also gives the user a grade based on the number of attempts they took to guess the correct number. The grading is based on the following scale:

A++: 2 or fewer attempts
A: 3 to 5 attempts
B: 6 to 10 attempts
C: More than 10 attempts
The program is designed to be interactive and user-friendly. It uses Java's built-in Random and Scanner classes to generate a random number and read input from the user, respectively. The program also provides helpful hints to the user by checking if the hidden number is even or odd and if it is divisible by any number between 2 and 12. The program's code has been modified to ensure that it adheres to professional programming standards, including proper indentation, comments, and variable naming conventions.
